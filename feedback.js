// Very good project and nice idea! It helped me to relax a bit in the evening :) So thank you guys! 
// I didn't immediately understand how to use it, so maybe you could add some hints. 
// I like that you practised the db connection and even the transaction, which wasn't mandatory. Cool!

// Only I wish you used Neon DB or created your tables from script. As I don't have access to your local db, I have to recreate your table somehow, which I know nothing about. But I love that you even thought about login/logout and didn't miss a chance to try it out. 

// Also, it would be nice if you used .gitignore to ignore node_modules. Not only is it good practice, but I actually got an error when running the application because of the module conflict. So don't forget to always put it in the ignore file :)
